# Purpose

Take an HTML page from bidexpress and parse it.


# Usage

Setup your debugger to input the html path:

1. Right click project `HTMLParser` in solution explorer
1. Click Properties
1. Go to Debug
1. Add `FULLHTML.html` as a command-line argument

This is because this is a CLI app that takes the first argument as a file path to an HTML file that it expects to exist and parse.
